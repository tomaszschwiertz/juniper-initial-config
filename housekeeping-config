The above config is enough to have a route running and maintaining it’s configuration.
From now-on – rest us lest to the engineer to add.

Good incidence on IP Addressing scheme:

Loopback Addresses: they take the form of 200.0.0.x with x the number of the router. So R5 has 200.0.0.5 as loopback address

P-t-P link Subnet: even if a /30 would be sufficient, we use a /24 network, which allows us to use the scheme 10.0.xy.0/24,
where x is the number of the lowest-numbered router connected to the P-t-P link and y is the number of the highest-numbered router connected to the P-t-P link.
So the link between R3 and R5 has the network 10.0.35.0/24. OSPF configuration forces P-t-P link type.

P-t-P link interface address: on a P-t-P link 10.0.xy.0/24 router Rx has address 10.0.xy.x and router Ry has address 10.0.xy.y
